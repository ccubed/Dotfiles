# Colors
A color scheme is stored in globalStyle.scss, but in general the colors were extracted from the wallpaper using coolors.co and slightly modified to be more bright or dark. You can find a list of colors and usage in globalStyle.scss

# Notes
This requires the experimental build tag for Waybar in order to expose the WLR Workspaces module.
